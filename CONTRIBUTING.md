Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## How to Contribute

- **Propose new sources:** Open an issue or pull request with your suggested blocklist source (please provide category and URL).
- **Bug reports:** If you find issues with the script or blocklists, please open a detailed issue.
- **Pull requests:** Fork the repository, create a feature branch, and submit a pull request with your changes.
- **Coding style:** Please use clear, commented code and English for all code and documentation.

## Guidelines

- Only high-quality, actively maintained blocklists will be accepted.
- Use the `<category>,<url>` format in `tools/urllist.txt`.
